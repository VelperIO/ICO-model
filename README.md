Presentation of a smart contract with a multistage token sale model


Our smart contract allows to divide process of token sale into several rounds (tiers).
Having collected the necessary amount of funds at each tier, team fulfills promised parts of the program, and only after that launches a new stage of financing. This allows investors to see real activity of the company, and the team gets an opportunity to resolve trust issue and warm up investor interest.

We offer for sale:

- 15% of tokens during the first tier (15 march 2018, 12:00 UTC — 15 april 2018, 00:00 UTC).
Price: 0,0001 ETH
Offering only 15 percent of the total amount of tokens for sale at the first stage, project team makes this sum achievable, based on the real costs required to implement this particular part of the project. All the funds raised will be put into product development, legislative registration and start of sales.

- 20% of tokens during the second tier (15 may 2018, 12:00 UTC — 17 june 2018, 00:00 UTC)
Price: 0,0002 ETH
On second tier token will cost twice as much, and token holders can sell 20% of their already purchased tokens for $ 40. After the second tier team planes to release the product, incentivize sales, and start digital marketing/advertising campaign.

- 20% of tokens during the third tier (12 july 2018, 12:00 UTC — 12 august 2018, 00:00 UTC)
Price: 0,0004 ETH
Third tier goal is to continue global marketing/advertising campaign and incentivize sales in 5 countries.

- 20% of tokens on the fourth tier (14 september 2018, 12:00 UTC — 14 october 2018, 00:00 UTC)
Price: 0,0008 ETH
After the fourth tier we are going to continue sales promotion in 12 countries and introduce new technologies into the system.
Listing on cryptocurrency exchange is planned on September 2018 between fourth and fifth tier, or possibly earlier, according to the tokenholder’s voting result.

- 25% of tokens on the fifth tier (10 december 2018 12:00 UTC — 31 december 2018 00:00 UTC)
Price: 0,0020 ETH
After the fifth tier we are going to continue sales in 35 countries.

Let’s consider an example: At the first stage of token sale project team offers to purchase 15% of their tokens in order to put collected funds into product development.
Imagine that during the first month you bought company’s tokens for $ 100. On second tier token will cost twice as much, and token holders can sell 20% of their already purchased tokens for $ 40. During the third tier, 20% of your tokens will already cost $ 80, on fourth 15% of tokens can be sold for $ 120, and on fifth — 10% for $ 200.
Thus, by investing only $ 100 in the first stage, regardless of the listing on exchange, you’ll get $ 440, and 35% of the tokens with minimum price of $ 700 will still remain with you. So, your total profit will be at least $ 1,140. Our smart contract guarantees the whole scheme functioning and the preemptive right to sell the tokens of the previous stage on the following stages.
To start our smart contract testing we’ve already deployed it in Rinkeby:
Ethereum Account 0x63Ef64148607460727daa991629a539D2E99A8dd Info
The Ethereum BlockChain Explorer, API and Analytics Platformrinkeby.etherscan.io

We also created two wallets for owner and beneficiary to allow smart contract working according to the previously described system:
