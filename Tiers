Unlike classical ICO model, where the promised program is implemented only after the completion of the crowdsale, new system breaks process of token sale for several rounds (tiers). 
Having collected the necessary amount at each stage, team fulfills promised points of its program, and only after that launches a new stage of financing. This allows investors to see real activity of the company, and the team get an opportunity to resolve trust issue and warm up investor interest.
Let’s consider the example:
At the first stage of crowdfunding project team offers to purchase 15% of their tokens at a price of $ 1 per token, in order to put collected funds into product development. Imagine that during the first month you bought company's tokens for $ 100. Already on the second tier token will cost twice as much, and you can sell 20% of your tokens for $ 40. During the third tier, 20% of your tokens will already cost $ 80, on fourth 15% of tokens can be sold for $ 120, and on fifth - 10% for $ 200. 
Thus, by investing only $ 100 during the first stage, you’ll get $ 1140 regardless of the listing on the stock exchange, in addition, 35% of the tokens still remain with you.
